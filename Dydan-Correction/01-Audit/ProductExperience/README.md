# Dydan Identity Audit And Remediation Closure - Product Experience

## Scope

- Repository: `alamoudimoh/DayDan-AppWeb-ProductExperience`
- Audit branch: `audit/dydan-identity-product-experience`
- Remediation branch: `fix/dydan-identity-product-experience`
- Baseline: `origin/main` at `764b6fb` (`revert: restore clean product experience baseline after Figma sync`)
- Audit date: 2026-09-15
- Method: tracked-file inventory using `git ls-files` and exact searches for `DayDan`, `Daydan`, `daydan`, `DAYDAN`, `Taskier`, `taskier`, `TASKIER`, `Donetick`, `donetick`, `DONETICK`, plus Arabic derived forms.

## Audit Baseline

| Metric | Count |
|---|---:|
| Tracked files scanned | 53 |
| Legacy content occurrences | 118 |
| Legacy path occurrences | 3 |
| Total audited occurrences | 121 |
| Affected tracked source files | 13 |
| Canonical English occurrences (`Dydan`) | 0 |
| Canonical Arabic occurrences (`دَيْدَن`) | 0 |

### Files Containing Legacy Identity

- `src/imports/pasted_text/daydan-product-brief.md`
- `src/index.css`
- `src/screens/AuthScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/ErrorScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/OnboardingScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/SharedStatesScreens.tsx`
- `tests/closure.spec.ts`

### Classification Counts

| Classification | Count | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| A - Safe Rename | 21 | User-visible copy and comments in the prototype runtime. |
| B - Technical Rename | 10 | In-memory theme discriminant and one assertion that must change together. |
| C - Compatibility Required | 0 | No shipped persisted or external identifier found. |
| D - Intentionally Preserve | 90 | Historical imported design inputs, including their legacy paths. |
| E - Remove | 0 | No identity-only runtime artifact was proven dead enough to remove without owner direction. |
| F - Investigate | 0 | No legacy occurrence requires external verification; see the non-occurrence Arabic identity decision below. |

## Remediation Closure

| Metric | Count |
|---|---:|
| Findings remediated | 31 |
| Safe rename findings remediated | 21 |
| Technical renames completed | 10 |
| Historical references retained | 26 |
| Non-shipped historical asset references retained | 64 |
| Active legacy references remaining | 0 |
| Unexplained legacy references remaining | 0 |

### Final Dispositions

- PX-001 through PX-031: **Remediated**. Active display copy now uses `Dydan`; the in-memory `Theme` discriminant and corresponding Playwright assertion now use `dydan`.
- PX-032 through PX-040 and PX-105 through PX-121: **Historical Preserve**. These are unbundled imported Figma source/provenance material and their legacy paths.
- PX-041 through PX-104: **Non-Shipped Legacy Asset**. `src/imports/DayDan-Color_Palette.html` is not part of the Vite import graph or runtime output. Its `taskier-lang` and `taskier-surface` keys remain intact because the standalone historical asset is not served.

### Arabic Identity Verification

- No active product surface renders Arabic product branding, so no new Arabic branding was introduced.
- Active source contains no incomplete, incorrectly diacritized, transliterated, or mixed legacy Arabic product identity.
- Any future Arabic product label must use exactly `دَيْدَن`.

## Highest-Risk Items

1. `daydan` is the in-memory `Theme` discriminant in `src/App.tsx` and `src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx`. It is not persisted in this prototype, but all producer, consumer, and test references must change atomically.
2. `src/imports/DayDan-Color_Palette.html` is an unbundled, standalone historical source file with `taskier-lang` and `taskier-surface` localStorage keys. It is not imported by runtime code. Do not rename those keys unless the asset is deliberately revived or shipped; then reclassify them as C and define migration behavior.
3. The error-report sample is local-only and copied to the clipboard; no reporting endpoint or parser is implemented. Treat its product label as a display rename, but confirm any future support ingestion contract before turning it into a network payload.

## Cross-Repository Dependencies

No implemented cross-repository contract was found. This prototype has no API client, API headers, environment identity value, browser storage, cookies, manifest/PWA metadata, service worker, cache name, push handler, deep link, route path, analytics identifier, package identity, Docker/deployment identity, or visual-baseline identity.

The app only models authentication, sessions, notifications, sync, and offline behavior in local React state or static copy. Those simulations are not contracts with Dydan Server, Dydan AppWeb, or Dydan Mobile.

## Arabic Product Label Decision

No product label currently renders the canonical Arabic identity `دَيْدَن`; the UI only exposes the generic language label `العربية`. This remediation did not introduce Arabic branding where it was not previously intended. Product/brand ownership must approve any future bilingual product-label surface.

## Completed Remediation Sequence

1. Renamed runtime display text, accessibility-facing text, comments, and the local-only error-report sample to `Dydan`.
2. Renamed the in-memory `daydan` theme discriminant to `dydan` with every producer, consumer, and Playwright assertion.
3. Confirmed the historical imports are outside the Vite entry/import graph; retained them without changing their provenance or standalone storage keys.
4. Reran tracked-file identity searches and the repository verification suite.

## Scope Confirmation

No API contract, browser storage, route, package metadata, deployment metadata, version, visual baseline, or cross-repository integration was changed. The product version remains `1.0.0`.

## Reproduction

```bash
git ls-files -z -- ':!Dydan-Correction/**' | xargs -0 rg -n -I -e 'DayDan|Daydan|daydan|DAYDAN|Taskier|taskier|TASKIER|Donetick|donetick|DONETICK|تاسكير|دونتيك|ديدان|دايدان|داي[[:space:]-]*دان|دي[[:space:]-]*دان|ديدن'
```
